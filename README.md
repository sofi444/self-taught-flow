## Speech to Speech Conversation with Speechmatics Flow ðŸŒ€


*coming soon: use Flow to facilitate self-learning from online videos


`python conversation.py` to chat with Jojo - he thinks he's funny... 


Speechmatics are known for their high-quality multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition. Flow is their conversational API (_early access_ at the time of writing!).

Flow supports **speaker diarization**, which means that based on acoustic features, it can detect multiple speakers in a conversation and keep track of speaker-specific information! 

And you can play around with the _persona_, _style_, and _context_ parameters to create your own character!

Turn on/off the transcripts by setting `SEE_TRANSCRIPTS = False`.

Some downsides I noticed:
- LLM component related mistakes. Hard to pinpoint without knowing their architecture exactly, but point is: it misunderstands often.
- Not possible to control voice style during the conversation.
- The default voice _amelia_ is painful to my ears.
